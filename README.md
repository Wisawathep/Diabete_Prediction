# Performance Comparison of Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression vs. XGBoost for Diabetes Prediction
This project presents a comparative study of machine learning models for diabetes prediction, focusing on Logistic Regression and XGBoost using a publicly available healthcare dataset. 
The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature analysis, model training, and hyperparameter optimization. Model performance is evaluated using multiple metrics such as ROC-AUC, 
accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, probability calibration (Brier score), inference latency, and model size. The project highlights practical trade-offs between predictive performance, 
interpretability, and computational efficiency in medical decision-support systems

## ⭐ Motivation
Diabetes mellitus is a major chronic disease that requires early detection to prevent severe health complications. Traditional diagnostic methods can be time-consuming, costly, 
and may fail to identify patients in early stages. This project was motivated by the potential of machine learning to support healthcare professionals by providing accurate, 
data-driven predictions. By comparing a simple and interpretable model (Logistic Regression) with a more powerful ensemble method (XGBoost), this study aims to provide insights 
into selecting appropriate models for different healthcare deployment scenarios.
